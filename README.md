ayai-backend
============

This repository contains the Java and Scala source files for the backend components of the AyAI server.
These components are:

<ul>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Game World Management / Entity System</li>
</ul>

We are using the Scala IDE for development: http://scala-ide.org/

You should also download the eGit plugin for the Scala Eclipse IDE: http://www.eclipse.org/egit/

After you have both of these things, do this in the Scala Eclipse IDE:
Import project -> Git -> Projects from Git -> URI ....  and at the end, import existing project.
